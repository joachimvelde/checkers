#+title: Checkers bot

This repository contains a full implementation of checkers written in rust, which includes a bot that uses the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for the user to play against. The python version is incomplete because it was abandoned in favour of rust, but I have still kept the code.
Interesting additions to the game would be the option for the user to change difficulty by adjusting the minimax
depth and being able to play locally or online against another human. But to avoid this being an everlasting project, I will consider the current rust version complete, and leave this here.

#+title: Checkers

This is a repository containing various unfinished implementations of checkers
in different languages. Currently the most complete implementation is the rust raylib
version, which implements the minimax algorithm to let the user play against a bot.
Still, this implementation contains various bugs, QOL-issues and unfinished logic.

* FIX:
- The bot is not locked to a single piece when performing successive kills.
- There is no way to handle situations where a player cannot move any pieces.

* ADD:
- Message announcing the winner
- Perhaps some randomness to the bot so that it does not perform the same opening every game, and a way for the player
  to change difficulty (minimax depth).
